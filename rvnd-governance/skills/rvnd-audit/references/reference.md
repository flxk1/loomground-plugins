# rvnd-audit - reference

## What it drives

The RVND audit chain and the security dashboard. This skill reads the per-folder Ed25519-signed
hash chain, verifies a receipt or a span of history against it, and reports the result with its
attribution and its limits. It is read-only and holds no signing capability of its own — the
server signs; this skill verifies.

## The chain

Every decision RVND applies is appended to a per-folder, Ed25519-signed hash chain. Each entry
links to the previous one, so an alteration breaks the chain from that point forward. Verification
checks that a receipt sits at its claimed position and that the signature holds.

Read the security dashboard (`security/v1`) alongside the chain for the server's own statement of
security decisions and known limitations — it is part of an honest report.

## Attribution — the whole point

A verified entry is not just "present". Report, for each decision:

- the **rule** that produced the verdict;
- the **signing key** the entry was signed under;
- the **approver** and rationale, for anything that loosened authority.

An entry missing any of these is incomplete. Render it as **unverified**, not as a pass.

## The limits — state them plainly

Do not let a green result overclaim:

- Tamper-evidence against an adversary who can also write the key directory holds **only** with
  the opt-in protections: encrypted keys at rest, genesis key pinning, and the log shipped
  off-host. Without those, a sufficiently privileged local attacker is outside what the chain
  proves.
- Erasure is a **signed tombstone**. It purges this folder's record and blocks re-ingestion. It
  cannot recall copies that already left the boundary; do not imply otherwise.
- The chain proves integrity of what was recorded. It does not prove that the policy behind a
  decision was correct — only that the decision was taken and signed as shown.

## Guardrails

- Read-only. This skill never appends, signs, or erases.
- Attributed, not asserted — no verdict without its rule, key, and approver.
- Verification status is a discrete lamp (verified / unverified), never a score.
- Fail-closed: a broken or unverifiable chain means downstream reliance stops, not "probably fine".

## Pairing

Verifies the receipts `rvnd-govern` and `rvnd-decide` produce. When an audit turns up something
wrong — a broken chain, an unauthorised action — `rvnd-incident` owns the response.
